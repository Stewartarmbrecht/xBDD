# xBDD
A Behavior Driven Development framework that runs on xUnit (or any other testing framework - hopefully).

Actually, this might be better defined as Behavior Documented Development.  
xBDD does not strive to create an environment where developers build tests to pass
gherkin statements written by someone else.  Rather, its expected that the developer
will determine and write the scenarios.

We believe that scenarios (written in gherkin) are design artifacts and 
should not be used as requirements.  That should be left to acceptance criteria.

In the ideal environment Product Owners focus on defining stories/features and acceptance criteria.
We see stories and features as the same thing, but we beleive acceptance criteria 
and scenarios are not.  We believe acceptance criteria should be design agnostic and should 
only further explain the user need in the story/feature.  Scenarios on the other
hand are very design aware and speak to how the system behaves in very specific circumstances.

## Goals

1. **Gherkin Style Output** - Reports can be generated from a test run that can be shared 
with a product owner or stakeholder to explain how the system has been designed to meet the user need.
2. **Database Accessible** - Ability to publish test passes to a database to allow for enhanced reporting
and serve as a basis for showing product growth/progress over time.
3. **Step Resuse** - The framework should encourage the development of step libraries that simplify
the process of building future tests.
4. **Intellisense Discovery** - A developer should be able to easily find existing steps using intellisense.
5. **Universal .Net Test Platform Integration** - While named similar to xUnit this framework should be usable
in any testing platform that supports .Net code.  (Right now it's only DNX supported)
6. **DNX Capable** - Capable of running where ever the cross platform .Net framework can.
4. **Hybrid Asynchronous Support** - You can define scenarios that run both synchronous and asynchronous steps.

## Example 

using Xunit;

    namespace xBDD.Test.Sample
    {
        public class LogIn

                s.Password = "mypassword";
                s.ExpectedMessage = "Welcome to the site!";
                s.PageTitle = "Home";
                xBDD.CurrentRun.AddScenario()
                    .When(s.the_user_logs_in_with_UserName_and_Password)
                    .Then(s.the_user_should_see_a_message_of_ExpectedMessage)
