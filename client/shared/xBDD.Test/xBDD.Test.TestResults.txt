xBDD

Environment
	Publish Test Results To Central Database
		Publish After CI Test Run
			When the developer pushes a commit to the master branch
			Then the CI process should build the solution, run the tests, and publish the results to a central database
		Publish After Test Run
			Given the developer sets the solution to the Publish configuration
			And the developer defines a valid connection string for an environment variable named 'Data:DefaultConnection:ConnectionString'
			When the developer runs the tests
			Then the test results should be published to the database
	Run Tests
		Run All Tests
			Given a contributor has downloaded the solution
			And the contributor runs the xBDD\RunJustTests.ps1 powershell script
			Then all tests will run
			And the test results will be written in plain text to the <ProjectName>.TestResults.txt file at the root of each project
			And the test results will be written in html to the <ProjectName>.TestResults.html file at the root of each project
			And the output from running the tests will be written to the <ProjectName>.Output.txt file at the root of each project
		Run Filtered Tests
			Given a contributor has downloaded the solution
			And marked a test method with a trait: '[Trait("category", "now")]'
			And has opened powershell
			And has navigated to the root folder of a project in powershell
			When the contributor runs 'dnx xunit.runner.dnx -trait "category=now"
			Then only the test that was marked will run
			And the test results will be written in plain text to the <ProjectName>.TestResults.txt file at the root of the project
			And the test results will be written in html to the <ProjectName>.TestResults.html file at the root of the project
			And the output from running the tests will be written to the <ProjectName>.Output.txt file at the root of the project
		Run Project Tests
			Given a contributor has downloaded the solution
			And opened powershell
			And has navigated to the root folder of a project in powershell
			When the contributor runs 'dnx test' in powershell
			Then all tests in that project will run
			And the test results will be written in plain text to the <ProjectName>.TestResults.txt file at the root of the project
			And the test results will be written in html to the <ProjectName>.TestResults.html file at the root of the project
			And the output from running the tests will be written to the <ProjectName>.Output.txt file at the root of the project
