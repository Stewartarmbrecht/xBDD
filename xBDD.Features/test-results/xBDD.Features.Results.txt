xBDD - Features - Getting Started
	Installing The Framework
		Via A Nuget Package
			Given you have created a test project
			When you excute the following command in the project directory:
				dotnet add package xBDD
			Then you will install the xBDD framework
	Executing Your First Scenario
		That Passes
			Given you have a similar class in your test project that defines your first scenario:
			When you execute the tests in the test project
			Then you will see the output matches this template (See TemplateValidator project on Nuget):
				My Sample Features
				
				My Sample - Features - My First Area
					My First Feature
						My First Scenario
							Given my step 1
							When my step 2
							Then my step 3
		That Failed
			Given you have a similar class in your test project that defines your first failing scenario:
			When you execute the tests in the test project
			Then you will see the output matches this template (See TemplateValidator project on Nuget):
				My Sample Features
				
				My Sample - Features - My First Area
					My First Failing Feature
						My First Scenario [Failed]
							Given my step 1
							When my step 2 [Failed]
								Error Type: Exception
								   Message: My first exception.
				{{				     Stack\:    at MySample\.Features\.MyFirstArea\.MyFirstFailingFeature\.\<\>c\.\<MyFirstScenario\>b__0_1\(Step s\) in .*xBDD[\\/]MySample\.Features[\\/]MyFirstArea[\\/]MyFirstFailingFeature\.cs\:line 24}}
				{{.*}}/rl
							Then my step 3 [Skipped - Previous Error]
	Leveraging Reusable Steps
		By Using An Actor Class
			Given you have a similar class in your test project for defining reusable steps:
			And you have a similar class in your test project that defines a feature using the reusable steps:
			When you execute the tests in the test project
			Then you will see the output matches this template (See TemplateValidator project on Nuget):
				My Sample Features
				
				My Sample - Features - My Area 1 All Passing
				{{.*}}/rl
					My Feature 4 Passing Reusable Steps
						My Scenario 10 With Reusable Steps
							Given you execute step 28
							When you execute step 29
							Then you execute step 30
xBDD - Features - Generate Reports - Generate Html Report
	Write To Html
		Standard Full Report
			Given you have a test project that produces all outcomes
			When you have a similar class in your test project for setting up and breaking down the test run that generates the html report:
			And you execute the tests in the test project
			Then you will see an html report is generated that displays the test results in a collapsible tree
				<!DOCTYPE html>

xBDD - Features - Generate Reports - Customize Html Report
	Write Failures Only
		Passing
			When you navigate to the test html report from a test run with all passing scenarios reporting failures only
			Then you will see the test run areas list is not there
		Skipped
			When you navigate to the test html report from a test run with passing and skipped scenarios reporting failures only
			Then you will see the test run areas list is not there
		Failing
			When you navigate to the test html report from a test run with passing, skipped, and failed scenarios and reporting failures only
			Then you will see the step 2 with red badge is visible because the step failed and the report will be expanded to the failed step
	Shorten Area Name
		Matches Start Of Area Name
			When you navigate to the test html report from a test run with all passing scenarios
			Then you will see the area 1 title line is visible
			And you will see the area 1 title line has text 'My Area 1 All Passing'
		Matches None Of Area Name
			When you navigate to the test html report from a test run with no area name removal
			Then you will see the area 1 title line is visible
			And you will see the area 1 title line has text 'My Sample - Features - My Area 1 All Passing'
		Matches All Of Area Name
			When you navigate to the test html report from a test run with no area name removal
			Then you will see the area 1 title line is visible
			And you will see the area 1 title line has text '[Missing! (or Full Name Skipped)]'
	Sort Test Run Results
		Not Sorted
			When you navigate to the test html report from an unsorted test run with passing, skipped, and failed scenarios
			And you click when the area 6 title line is visible
			And you click when the feature 13 name is visible
			Then you will see the feature 13 name has text 'My Feature 12 Third' because it was the first feature alphabetically
			And you will see the scenario 33 name has text 'My Scenario 30 Unsorted 38 Sorted' because it is the first scenario alphabetically
		Sorted
			When you navigate to the test html report from a fully sorted test run with passing, skipped, and failed scenarios
			And you click when the area 6 title line is visible
			And you click when the feature 13 name is visible
			Then you will see the feature 13 name has text 'My Feature 13 First' because it was sorted to be first
			And you will see the scenario 33 name has text 'My Scenario 35 Unsorted 30 Sorted' because it is the first scenario sorted
		Partially Sorted
			When you navigate to the test html report from a test run with passing, skipped, and failed scenarios
			And you click when the area 9 title line is visible
			And you click when the feature 19 name is visible
			Then you will see the feature 19 name has text 'My Feature 0 Unsorted' because it was the second in the feature sort
			And you will see the scenario 45 name has text 'My Scenario 0 Unsorted' because it was not provided a sort when the scenario was created and was placed after the sorted scenarios
