xBDD - Features - Getting Started
	Installing The Framework
		Via A Nuget Package
			Given you have created a test project
			When you excute the following command in the project directory:
				dotnet add package xBDD
			Then you will install the xBDD framework
	Executing Your First Scenario
		Executing A Passing Web UI Scenario In An MS Test Project
			Given you have a similar class in your test project for defining a passing scenario:
			When you run the MS Test Project with the following command:
				dotnet test -v n --filter FullyQualifiedName=Amazon.Features.SearchingProducts.SearchingAllProducts.SearchWithSearchButton
			Then you will see the output matches this template (See TemplateValidator project on Nuget):
				{{.*}}/rl
				Passed   SearchWithSearchButton
				{{.*}}/rl
				Test Run Successful.
				{{.*}}/rl
		Executing A Failing Web UI Scenario In An MS Test Project
			Given you have a similar class in your test project that defines a failing scenario:
			When you run the MS Test Project with the following command:
				dotnet test --filter Name~SearchWithSearchButton_Failing
			Then you will see the output matches this template (See TemplateValidator project on Nuget):
				{{.*}}/rl
				Failed   SearchWithSearchButton_Failing
				Error Message:

	Shorten Area Name
		Matches Start Of Area Name
			Given you generate an html report from test results of a single passing scenario set to skip the string 'My ' in the area name
			When you navigate to the test html report with a single passing scenario
			Then you will see the area title line is visible
			And you will see the area title line has text 'Area 1'
		Matches None Of Area Name
			Given you generate an html report from test results of a single passing scenario set to skip the string 'No Match' in the area name
			When you navigate to the test html report with a single passing scenario
			Then you will see the area title line is visible
			And you will see the area title line has text 'My Area 1'
		Matches All Of Area Name
			Given you generate an html report from test results of a single passing scenario set to skip the string 'My Area 1' in the area name
			When you navigate to the test html report with a single passing scenario
			Then you will see the area title line is visible
			And you will see the area title line has text '[Missing! (or Full Name Skipped)]'
	Sort Test Run Results
		Not Sorted
			Given you generate an html report from a test run that is not sorted
			When you navigate to the sample test html report that is not sorted
			And you click when the area title line is visible
			And you click when the feature name is visible
			Then you will see the feature name has text 'Sample All Outcome Feature' because it was the first feature alphabetically
			And you will see the scenario name has text 'Failed Scenario' because it is the first scenario alphabetically
		Sorted
			Given you generate an html report from a test run that is sorted
			When you navigate to the sample test html report that is sorted
			And you click when the area title line is visible
			And you click when the feature name is visible
			Then you will see the feature name has text 'Sample Passing Feature' because it was the first in the feature sort
			And you will see the scenario name has text 'Passing Scenario3' because it is the first in the feature class definition
		Partially Sorted
			Given you generate an html report from a test run that is sorted
			When you navigate to the sample test html report that is sorted
			And you click when the area title line is visible
			And you click when the feature name is visible
			Then you will see the feature name has text 'Sample Skipped Feature' because it was the second in the feature sort
			And you will see the scenario name has text 'Passing Scenario2' because it was not provided a sort when the scenario was created and was placed after the sorted scenarios
