	Finding Thex BDD Project Site
		Search For XBDD
			Given you navigate to the google search page
			When you enter the text 'xBDD C#' into the the search box input
			Then you will see the first results has text 'GitHub - Stewartarmbrecht/xBDD: Behavior Driven Development ...'
	Installing The Framework
		For An N Unit Project [Skipped - Not Started]
		For An Xunit Project [Skipped - Not Started]
		If You Use An MS Test Project
			Then you create an MSTest project by following the directions here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/testing/unit-testing-with-mstest
			And you can install xBDD by executing:
				dotnet add package xBDD
