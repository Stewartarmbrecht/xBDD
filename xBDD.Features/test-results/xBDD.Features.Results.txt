xBDD Features

xBDD - Features - Getting Started
	Installing The Framework
		Via A Nuget Package
			Given you have created a test project
			When you excute the following command in the project directory:
				dotnet add package xBDD
			Then you will install the xBDD framework
	Executing Your First Scenario
		That Passes
			Given you have a similar class in your test project that defines your first scenario:
			When you execute the tests in the test project
			Then you will see the output matches this template (See TemplateValidator project on Nuget):
				My Sample Features
				
				My Sample - Features - My First Area
					My First Feature
						My First Scenario
							Given my step 1
							When my step 2
							Then my step 3
		That Failed
			Given you have a similar class in your test project that defines your first failing scenario:
			When you execute the tests in the test project
			Then you will see the output matches this template (See TemplateValidator project on Nuget):
				My Sample Features
				
				My Sample - Features - My First Area
					My First Failing Feature
						My First Scenario [Failed]
							Given my step 1
							When my step 2 [Failed]
								Error Type: Exception
								   Message: My first exception.

	Leveraging Reusable Steps
		By Using An Actor Class
			Given you have a similar class in your test project for defining reusable steps:
			And you have a similar class in your test project that defines a feature using the reusable steps:
			When you execute the tests in the test project
			Then you will see the output matches this template (See TemplateValidator project on Nuget):
				My Sample Features
				
				My Sample - Features - My Area 1 All Passing
				{{.*}}/rl
					My Feature 4 Passing Reusable Steps
						My Scenario 10 With Reusable Steps
							Given you execute step 28
							When you execute step 29
							Then you execute step 30
xBDD - Features - Generate Reports - Generate Html Report
	Write To Html
		Standard Full Report
			Given you have a test project that produces all outcomes
			When you have a similar class in your test project for setting up and breaking down the test run that generates the html report:
			And you execute the tests in the test project
			Then you will see an html report is generated that displays the test results in a collapsible tree
				<!DOCTYPE html>
				<html>
				{{.*}}/rl
				</html>
xBDD - Features - Generate Reports - Browse Html Report
	Review Test Run

xBDD - Features - Generate Reports - Generate Json Report
	Write To Json
		Standard Full Report
			Given you execute a test run
			When you execute the following code:
				string report = xBDD.CurrentRun.WriteToJson()
			Then the report string will contains the entire Json representation of the test run
xBDD - Features - Generate Code
	Generate Project Files From Test Run Results
		Standard Full Report
			Given you have a test project that produces all outcomes
			And you have a similar class in your test project for setting up and breaking down the test run that includes the line to generate code:
			And you include this line of code:
				xBDD.CurrentRun.WriteToCode("MySample.Features", "./Code/", "My Sample - Features - ")
			When you execute the tests in the test project
			Then the following files will be generated.
