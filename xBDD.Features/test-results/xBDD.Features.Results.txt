	Executing Your First Scenario
		That Will Test A Web Interface
			Given you code the following feature definition:
				namespace Amazon.Features.SearchingProducts
				{
				    using Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting;
				    using System;
				    using System.Threading.Tasks;
				    using xBDD;
				    using xBDD.Browser;
				
					[TestClass]
					[AsA("anonymous user")]
					[YouCan("search across all amazon products")]
					[By("using primary search bar on the home page")]
					public class SearchingAllProducts: IFeature
					{
						private User you = new User();
						public IOutputWriter OutputWriter { get; private set; }
				
						public SearchingAllProducts()
						{
							OutputWriter = new TestContextWriter();
						}
						
						[TestMethod]
						public async Task SearchWithSearchButton()
						{
							await xB.AddScenario(this)
								.Given(you.NavigateTo("the amazon home page","https://www.amazon.com"))
								.When(you.EnterTheText("echo").In("the search box", "#twotabsearchtextbox"))
								.And(you.Click("the search button", "input[type=submit]"))
								.Then(you.WillSee("the search results", "#s-results-list-atf").IsVisible())
								.Run();
						}
					}
				}
			When you run the MS Test Project
			Then you will see the output matches this template (See TemplateValidator project on Nuget):
				{{.*}}/rl
				Passed   SearchWithSearchButton
				{{.*}}/rl
				Test Run Successful.
				{{.*}}/rl
	Finding Thex BDD Project Site
		Search For XBDD
			Given you navigate to the google search page
			When you enter the text System.Collections.Generic.List`1[System.String] into the the search box input
			Then you will see the first results has text 'GitHub - Stewartarmbrecht/xBDD: Behavior Driven Development ...'
	Installing The Framework
		For An N Unit Project [Skipped - Not Started]
		For An Xunit Project [Skipped - Not Started]
		If You Use An MS Test Project
			Then you create an MSTest project by following the directions here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/testing/unit-testing-with-mstest
			And you can install xBDD by executing:
				dotnet add package xBDD
