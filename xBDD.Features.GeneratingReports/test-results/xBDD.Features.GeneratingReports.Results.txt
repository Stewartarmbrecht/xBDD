	Generate A Report [Defining]
		With Full Test Run [Committed]
			Given you have the following json test run reports
				./MySamle.Features.TestRun1Passing/test-results/MySamle.Features.TestRun1Passing.json
				./MySamle.Features.TestRun2SkippedUntested/test-results/MySamle.Features.TestRun2SkippedUntested.json
				./MySamle.Features.TestRun3SkippedBuilding/test-results/MySamle.Features.TestRun3SkippedBuilding.json
				./MySamle.Features.TestRun4SkippedReady/test-results/MySamle.Features.TestRun4SkippedReady.json
				./MySamle.Features.TestRun5SkippedDefining/test-results/MySamle.Features.TestRun5SkippedReady.json
				./MySamle.Features.TestRun6Failed/test-results/MySamle.Features.TestRun6Failed.json
			When you execute the xBDD Tools Command
				dotnet xbdd solution summarize `
				./MySamle.Features.TestRun1Passing/test-results/MySamle.Features.TestRun1Passing.json `
				./MySamle.Features.TestRun2SkippedUntested/test-results/MySamle.Features.TestRun2SkippedUntested.json `
				./MySamle.Features.TestRun3SkippedBuilding/test-results/MySamle.Features.TestRun3SkippedBuilding.json `

				./MySamle.Features.TestRun6Failed/test-results/MySamle.Features.TestRun6Failed.json `
			Then the project will generate an Html summary report
				./MySample/test-results/MySample.Summary.html
			And you can view the report in a browser

xBDD - Features - Generating Reports - HTML Test Run Report - Generating [Untested]
	Generate A Report [Untested]
		With Full Test Run [Untested]
			Given you have a test run project that creates all outcomes
			When you execute the dotnet test command
				dotnet test
			Then the project will generate an Html test run report that has all features exercised
		With No Scenarios [Untested]
			Given you have a test run project that does not have any scenarios
			When you execute the command
				dotnet test
			Then the project will generate an empty Html test run report
		With No Tests In The Project [Untested]
			Given you have a test run project that does not have any tests
			When you execute the command
				dotnet test
			Then the project will generate an empty Html test run report
	Generate A Failures Only Report [Untested]
		With Failures [Untested]
			Given you have a test run project that creates all outcomes
			When you execute the dotnet test command with the failures only environment variable set to true
				$Emv:xBDD:HtmlReport:FailuresOnly = "true"
				dotnet test
			Then the project will generate an Html test run report that has only the failed scenarios
		With No Scenarios [Untested]
			Given you have a test run project that does not have any scenarios
			When you execute the dotnet test command with the failures only environment variable set to true
				$Emv:xBDD:HtmlReport:FailuresOnly = "true"
				dotnet test
			Then the project will generate an empty Html test run report
		With No Failures [Untested]
			Given you have a test run project that is passing
			When you execute the dotnet test command with the failures only environment variable set to true
				$Emv:xBDD:HtmlReport:FailuresOnly = "true"
				dotnet test
			Then the project will generate an Html test run report that has only the failed scenarios
	View A Report [Untested]
		From A File Server [Untested]
			Given you have executed a test run project that creates all outcomes
