	Generate A Report
		With Full Test Run
			Given you have the following json test run reports
				./MySample.Features.TestRun1Passing/test-results/MySample.Features.TestRun1Passing.Results.json,
				./MySample.Features.TestRun2SkippedUntested/test-results/MySample.Features.TestRun2SkippedUntested.Results.json,
				./MySample.Features.TestRun3SkippedCommitted/test-results/MySample.Features.TestRun3SkippedCommitted.Results.json,
				./MySample.Features.TestRun4SkippedReady/test-results/MySample.Features.TestRun4SkippedReady.Results.json,
				./MySample.Features.TestRun5SkippedDefining/test-results/MySample.Features.TestRun5SkippedDefining.Results.json,
				./MySample.Features.TestRun6Failed/test-results/MySample.Features.TestRun6Failed.Results.json
			When you run the command:
				dotnet xbdd solution summarize --output MySample.TestSummary.html --name My Sample - Features --testrun-name-clip My Sample - Features -  --reason-order Untested, Committed, Ready, Defining ./MySample.Features.TestRun1Passing/test-results/MySample.Features.TestRun1Passing.Results.json ./MySample.Features.TestRun2SkippedUntested/test-results/MySample.Features.TestRun2SkippedUntested.Results.json ./MySample.Features.TestRun3SkippedCommitted/test-results/MySample.Features.TestRun3SkippedCommitted.Results.json ./MySample.Features.TestRun4SkippedReady/test-results/MySample.Features.TestRun4SkippedReady.Results.json ./MySample.Features.TestRun5SkippedDefining/test-results/MySample.Features.TestRun5SkippedDefining.Results.json ./MySample.Features.TestRun6Failed/test-results/MySample.Features.TestRun6Failed.Results.json
			Then you will see output matching the following template:
				Output: MySample.TestSummary.html
				Name: My Sample - Features
				TestRunNameClip: My Sample - Features - 
				Reasons: Untested, Committed, Ready, Defining
				Json Report: ./MySample.Features.TestRun1Passing/test-results/MySample.Features.TestRun1Passing.Results.json
				Json Report: ./MySample.Features.TestRun2SkippedUntested/test-results/MySample.Features.TestRun2SkippedUntested.Results.json
				Json Report: ./MySample.Features.TestRun3SkippedCommitted/test-results/MySample.Features.TestRun3SkippedCommitted.Results.json
				Json Report: ./MySample.Features.TestRun4SkippedReady/test-results/MySample.Features.TestRun4SkippedReady.Results.json
				Json Report: ./MySample.Features.TestRun5SkippedDefining/test-results/MySample.Features.TestRun5SkippedDefining.Results.json
				Json Report: ./MySample.Features.TestRun6Failed/test-results/MySample.Features.TestRun6Failed.Results.json
			And you will find a new HTML Report created at './MySample.TestSummary.html' file located at 'C:\Users\stearm01\source\xBDD\xBDD.Features.GeneratingReports\bin\Debug\netcoreapp2.1/../../../../MySample/MySample.TestSummary.html'.
				C:\Users\stearm01\source\xBDD\xBDD.Features.GeneratingReports\bin\Debug\netcoreapp2.1/../../../../MySample/MySample.TestSummary.html
		With No Json Files
			Given you do not have a summary report file located at './MySample.TestSummary.WithNoJsonFiles.html'.
				./MySample.TestSummary.WithNoJsonFiles.html
			When you run the command:
				dotnet xbdd solution summarize --output ./MySample.TestSummary.WithNoJsonFiles.html --name My Sample - Features --testrun-name-clip My Sample - Features -  --reason-order Untested, Committed, Ready, Defining
			Then you will see output matching the following template:
				Output: ./MySample.TestSummary.WithNoJsonFiles.html
				Name: My Sample - Features
				TestRunNameClip: My Sample - Features - 
				Reasons: Untested, Committed, Ready, Defining
			And you will find a file at 'C:\Users\stearm01\source\xBDD\xBDD.Features.GeneratingReports\bin\Debug\netcoreapp2.1/../../../../MySample/./MySample.TestSummary.WithNoJsonFiles.html' that matches the template:
				{{.*}}/rl
					<title>My Sample - Features</title>
				{{.*}}/rl
						<h1 class="report-name">
							<span class="report badge pointer badge-pill total badge-secondary" title="Test Runs">0</span>
							<span class="name">My Sample - Features</span>
							<span class="report duration"> [0 ms]</span>
						</h1>
				{{.*}}/rl
		With A Single Json File
			Given you do not have a summary report file located at './MySample.TestSummary.WithASingleJsonFile.html'.
				./MySample.TestSummary.WithASingleJsonFile.html
			When you run the command:
				dotnet xbdd solution summarize --output ./MySample.TestSummary.WithASingleJsonFile.html --name My Sample - Features --testrun-name-clip My Sample - Features -  --reason-order Untested, Committed, Ready, Defining ./MySample.Features.TestRun1Passing/test-results/MySample.Features.TestRun1Passing.Results.json
			Then you will see output matching the following template:
				Output: ./MySample.TestSummary.WithASingleJsonFile.html
				Name: My Sample - Features
				TestRunNameClip: My Sample - Features - 
				Reasons: Untested, Committed, Ready, Defining
				Json Report: ./MySample.Features.TestRun1Passing/test-results/MySample.Features.TestRun1Passing.Results.json
			And you will find a file at 'C:\Users\stearm01\source\xBDD\xBDD.Features.GeneratingReports\bin\Debug\netcoreapp2.1/../../../../MySample//./MySample.TestSummary.WithASingleJsonFile.html' that matches the template:
				{{.*}}/rl

							<span class="name">My Sample - Features</span>
							<span class="report reason"> [Defining]</span>
							<span class="report duration"> [0 ms]</span>
						</h1>
				{{.*}}/rl
		With A Missing Json File
			Given you do not have a summary report file located at './MySample.TestSummary.WithAMissingJsonFile.html'.
				./MySample.TestSummary.WithAMissingJsonFile.html
			When you run the command:
				dotnet xbdd solution summarize --output ./MySample.TestSummary.WithAMissingJsonFile.html --name My Sample - Features --testrun-name-clip My Sample - Features -  --reason-order Untested, Committed, Ready, Defining ./Missing.json
			Then you will see output matching the following template:
				Output: ./MySample.TestSummary.WithAMissingJsonFile.html
				Name: My Sample - Features
				TestRunNameClip: My Sample - Features - 
				Reasons: Untested, Committed, Ready, Defining
				Json Report: ./Missing.json
				Error: Could not find file 'C:\Users\stearm01\source\xBDD\MySample\Missing.json'.
			And you will not find the html report located at 'C:\Users\stearm01\source\xBDD\xBDD.Features.GeneratingReports\bin\Debug\netcoreapp2.1/../../../../MySample/./MySample.TestSummary.WithAMissingJsonFile.html'.

	Generate A Report [Untested]
		With Full Test Run [Untested]
			Given you have a test run project that creates all outcomes
			When you execute the dotnet test command
				dotnet test
			Then the project will generate an Html test run report that has all features exercised
		With No Scenarios [Untested]
			Given you have a test run project that does not have any scenarios
			When you execute the command
				dotnet test
			Then the project will generate an empty Html test run report
		With No Tests In The Project [Untested]
			Given you have a test run project that does not have any tests
			When you execute the command
				dotnet test
			Then the project will generate an empty Html test run report
	Generate A Failures Only Report [Untested]
		With Failures [Untested]
			Given you have a test run project that creates all outcomes
			When you execute the dotnet test command with the failures only environment variable set to true
				$Emv:xBDD:HtmlReport:FailuresOnly = "true"
				dotnet test
			Then the project will generate an Html test run report that has only the failed scenarios
		With No Scenarios [Untested]
			Given you have a test run project that does not have any scenarios
			When you execute the dotnet test command with the failures only environment variable set to true
				$Emv:xBDD:HtmlReport:FailuresOnly = "true"
				dotnet test
			Then the project will generate an empty Html test run report
		With No Failures [Untested]
			Given you have a test run project that is passing
			When you execute the dotnet test command with the failures only environment variable set to true
				$Emv:xBDD:HtmlReport:FailuresOnly = "true"
				dotnet test
			Then the project will generate an Html test run report that has only the failed scenarios
	View A Report [Untested]
		From A File Server [Untested]
			Given you have executed a test run project that creates all outcomes
			Then you can view the html report by loading the following file into your browser
