HTML Summary Report - Generating #R-Defining
	Generate a report @Stewart
		With Full Test Run #R-Committed
			Given you have the following json test run reports
				Input
					./MySamle.Features.TestRun1Passing/test-results/MySamle.Features.TestRun1Passing.json
					./MySamle.Features.TestRun2SkippedUntested/test-results/MySamle.Features.TestRun2SkippedUntested.json
					./MySamle.Features.TestRun3SkippedBuilding/test-results/MySamle.Features.TestRun3SkippedBuilding.json
					./MySamle.Features.TestRun4SkippedReady/test-results/MySamle.Features.TestRun4SkippedReady.json
					./MySamle.Features.TestRun5SkippedDefining/test-results/MySamle.Features.TestRun5SkippedReady.json
					./MySamle.Features.TestRun6Failed/test-results/MySamle.Features.TestRun6Failed.json
			When you execute the xBDD Tools Command
				Input
					dotnet xbdd solution summarize `
					./MySamle.Features.TestRun1Passing/test-results/MySamle.Features.TestRun1Passing.json `
					./MySamle.Features.TestRun2SkippedUntested/test-results/MySamle.Features.TestRun2SkippedUntested.json" `

					./MySamle.Features.TestRun6Failed/test-results/MySamle.Features.TestRun6Failed.json `
			Then the project will generate an Html summary report
				Input
					./MySample/test-results/MySample.Summary.html
			And you can view the report in a browser
